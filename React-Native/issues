react-native run-android - Error: File path too long on Windows, keep below 240 characters
or npm run android -  Error: File path too long on Windows, keep below 240 characters

## solution: 
Change your build directory for your project since that is where most of the path issues will arise. 
In your root build.gradle file

allprojects {
    buildDir = "C:/tmp/${rootProject.name}/${project.name}"
    repositories {
       ...
    }
}
