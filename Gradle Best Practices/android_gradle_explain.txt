Android projects are Gradle multi-project builds, with a top-level build.gradle file and a subdirectory called app, with its own build.gradle file. The top-level build file is noted as (Project: HelloWorldGradle) in the figure, and the app build file has (Module: app) appended to it.

There may be two files called gradle.properties. One is local to the project. The other, optional file of the same name exists only if you have a global gradle.properties file in the .gradle sub-directory of your home directory.

-The file settings.gradle is used by Gradle to configure the multi-project build. It should consist of a single line:
```
include ':app'
```

This tells Gradle that the app sub-directory is also a Gradle project. If, at some later time, you were to add an Android Library to this project through the available wizard, another project sub-directory would be created and added to this file.

The last file is called gradle-wrapper.properties, which configures the so-called Gradle Wrapper. This allows you to build Android projects without having to install Gradle first. The contents of the file should be similar to:
```
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.1-all.zip
```

The first four lines indicate that when the wrapper runs the first time, it will download a Gradle distribution and store it in the directory .gradle/wrapper/dists in your home directory.

The last line shows the value of the distributionUrl, which is the location where Gradle will download the distribution specified.
